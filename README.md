#Yat

##Yat is a way to find and share your friends' locations by just sending an email

Yat uses the sendgrid API, and won the sendgrid API prize at Calhacks 2014. The following codebase does not contain any API keys and so does not work right away.

###APIs
- Google Maps API
- Yelp's API
- Wit.Ai's Natural Language Processing API
- Sendgrid Parse Webhook

###Technologies
- Node.js
- Mongodb
